    - Attention Guided Filterï¼š**contains the <u>guided filter</u> and <u>attention block</u> to filter out the noise from the background and address <u>the boundary blur problem</u> caused by upsampling.**
    - Using **filter feature map** to be close to **guidence feature map** to clear the boundary.
